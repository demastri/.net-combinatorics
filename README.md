### Combinatorics Library for .Net ###

This is a simple to use library that implements:

* combinations, permutations, variations
* with and without repetitions
* default usage is for automatic manipulation of 0-based integer sequences
* support for mapping the symbols used in the sequence to any arbitrary objects or symbols
* allows for easy, strongly typed manipulation of arbitrary objects / types

It's implemented as a basic .net class library, written in C#, so...
>pull it, compile, reference, code...

there's an included test program in the solution to be sure you've got everything working correctly
no dependencies on any other libraries (mine or anyone's....)  

* Version 1.0
